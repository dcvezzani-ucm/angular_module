angular_module
==============

Create framework for an angular module.

Are you a Rails developer new to Angular JS?  I pulled together this project to help myself add Angular JS modules to a Rails application by using a Rails generator.  Each module includes Jasmine e2e and unit tests.  The Angular JS modules are separated by using some logic in a common controller to determine which Angular app will control the page.

Once the modules have been generated, you change things around to your heart's content.

Caveat
======

Some of the scripts that are generated by the generator are geared for a Unix-like environment, but are small and simple enough that Windows versions could be easily created.

Getting Started
===============

Create the Rails application

  rails new ang3_app --database=postgresql --skip-test-unit
  echo "2.1.0" > ang3_app/.ruby-version
  cd ang3_app
